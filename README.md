## 1) Bike Sales dashboard

In this project, I have created a dashboard on bike sales for the stakeholders so that they can analyse the sales across different categories using various advance excel skills.

### Contents of the excel file: 
- **Raw Data**- 'Bike_buyers' 
- **Transformed Data**- 'Worksheet' 
- **Pivot Charts**-  Customer Age Groups, Sales Region, Commute distance, Customer Avg Income 
- **Dashboard**

**Skills used:** Pivot charts, Slicing, Sorting and filtering, Removing duplicates.
